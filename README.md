<p align="center"><img src="devops-img/devops.png" height="250px"></p><br>
<ul>
<li>What DevOps concepts & tools to learn ?</li>
<li>Tasks & Responsibilities ?</li>
</ul>
 
## 🔰 There are two Departments
🔹 **DEVELOPMENT** :-
- deploying of application
- testing of application

🔹 **OPERATIONS** :-
- deployment of application
- maintained on a server

## 🔰 Concepts of Software Development
**Development** <br>
✅ Git <br>
✅ How developers work <br>
✅ Which git workflow <br>
✅ How application is configured <br>
✅ Automated testing <br>

## 🔰 Operating System & Linux Basics
🔹 Operations -> Server <br>
🔹 Prepare the infrastructure <br>
✅ Linux Basics <br>
✅ Comfortable using CLI <br>
✅ Shell commands <br>
✅ Linux File System <br>
✅ Server Management <br>
✅ SSH Key Management <br>

## 🔰 Networking & Security
✅  Firewall, Proxy Servers <br>
✅ Load Balancers <br>
✅ HTTP/HTTPS <br>
✅ IP, DNS Name Resolution <br>

## 🔰 Containers
✅ Virtualization <br>
✅ Containers <br>
✅ Docker <br>

## 🔰 How to release the Operations?
**Build Automation & CI/CD** <br>
✅ Build Tools & Package Manager <br>
(Maven & Gradle -> Java app. , npm -> JS app.) <br>
✅ Build Docker Images <br>
✅ Artifact Repository (Nexus, Docker Hub) <br>
✅ Build Automation (Jenkins, GitLab, GitHub Actions) <br>
✅ Configure complete CI/CD pipeline <br>

## 🔰 Cloud Providers
**Infrastructure as a Service** <br>
AWS, Google Cloud, Azure <br>
🔹 Save costs <br>
🔹 Offer a range of services - Load balancing, Backup, Clustering, Security, ... <br>
🔹 Many services are Platform-specific services <br>
🔹 There are too many services <br>
🔹 Only learn services you actually need <br>

## 🔰 Container Orchestration

🔹For small containers - <br>
✅ Docker compose, Docker Swarm <br>
<br>
🔹If we have lot more containers or Incase of big microservices <br>
We need more powerful tool <br><br>
✅ Kubernetes <br>
🚩 Learn K8s  <br>
🚩 How it works, Administor & Manage the cluster, Deploy applications <br>

## 🔰 Monitoring
- Track Performance
- Discover Problems <br>
✅ Monitor Software <br>
✅ Monitor Infrastructure <br>
Tools - Prometheus, Nagios, etc.

## 🔰 Infrastructure as Code

🔹 For Production, Testing, Dvelopment <br>
🔹 You need more than one environment <br>
🔹 Manually creating & maintaining the environment :- <br>
- Time consuming
- Error prone <br>
 <br>
🔸 Use code to :- <br>
<ul>
<li>Create infrastructure</li>
<li>Configure to run & deploy your app</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
 <li>Infra. Provisioning (Terraform)</li>
 <li>Config. management (Ansible, Chef, Puppet)</li>
</ul>
<br>
🔹You should know one of these tools to be:- <br>
<ul>
<li>More efficient</li>
<li>Transparent</li>
<li>Easy to replicate & recover</li>
</ul>

## 🔰 Scripting Language
🔹 Automating tasks for development & operations :-  <br>
Backups, cron jobs, system monitoring <br>
<br>
✅ Know a Scripting Language  <br>
🚩 OS-specific - bash, shell  <br>
🚩 OS-independent - Python, Ruby, Go <br><br>

🌟 Python is most popular <br>
🚩 Easy to read <br>
🚩 Easy to learn <br>
🚩 Many Libraries for most of Databases, OS Tasks & Cloud Platforms

## 🔰 Version Control
✅ Git <br>
✅ GitHub <br>

## ❗ How many tools to learn?

🔹 One tool in each category <br>
🔹 Most popular / widely used <br>
